				    <h1>Fallon History</h1>
				
				    <h2>The Fallon Name</h2>
                    <p>
                    The Fallon family are of Celtic stock whose Gaelic name was O'Fallamhain. Fallamhan in Irish means "ruler." O'Fallamain means the "descendant of the ruler."
                    The Fallons were a noted Connacht family whose members lived in Counties Roscommon and Galway. The heads of the sept were known as Lords of Clan Udach and ruled over a territory comprising the modern parishes of Camma and Dysart in Athlone in County Roscommon.
                    The family seat was at Milltown in the parish of Dysart where the ruins of the ancestral castle along the eastern bank of the Ballyglass River are still to be seen. Another branch of the family held estates in the neighbourhood of Ballinasloe, County Galway. Their stronghold was Runnamoat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    O’Fallons mentioned in The Four Masters The Annals of the Four Masters says of the O'Fallons:
                    "The O'Fallons, who marched with every force Were chiefs of Clan Uadach of wine banquets, Men who let not their spears decay
                    Of those are the freeborn clans."
                    O'Fallanihain, or O'Fallons, chief of Clan Uadach, a district in the barony of Athlone, County of Roscommon, comprising the parishes of Cam and Dysart, had a castle at Milltown.
                    The O'Fallons were originally chiefs in Westmeath near Athlone. Several chiefs of the O'Fallons are mentioned in the course of the Annals.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Cloonagh House</h2>
                    <p>
                    A branch of the Gaelic chieftain family of O'Fallon was granted land at Ballina in the parish of Taghboy, barony of Athlone, county Roscommon, 
                    in 1654. 
                    Cloonagh House was the home of a branch of the Fallon family from the mid 18th century. 
                    In 1749 William Fallon was living at Ballina and Patrick Fallon at nearby Cloonagh. 
                    William Fallon had a son Malachy renowned for fighting duels. Wilson refers to it as the seat of John Fallon in 1786. 
                    At the time of Griffith's Valuation Anthony Fallon held an estate centred on his house at Ballina. 
                    His estate of 318 acres was advertised for sale in May 1867. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The Reverend James O'Fallon, Bishop of Elphin 1756-1786 was a brother of Patrick Fallon of Cloonagh. 
                    Occupied by James Mannion in 1814 and described in the 1830s as "a well built modern mansion forming three fourths of a cross". It is now a ruin.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Dysart Village</h2>
                    <p>
                    Dysart comes from the Irish word ‘Díseart’ meaning hermitage or hermit’s church. The partially restored medieval parish church with its Romanesque doorway is situated in Dysart cemetery. The present church in the village of Dysart, which is one of the oldest in the diocese, was built in 1825 and is dedicated to St. Patrick. It replaced a nearby church from the era of the Penal Laws, which was a place of worship from the late 18th century.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Dysart is a village in County Roscommon. It lies 20 km (12 miles) from the centre of Athlone, on the R363 regional road.
                    Located at the crossroads of the R363 and the R357 it was formally known as Thomas Street. Dysart village consists of the following: two public houses (Fallons and Hobans), a Roman Catholic Church, a community centre, a Roman Catholic Graveyard and a soccer pitch (home of Dysart FC).
                    </p>
